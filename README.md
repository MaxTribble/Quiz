## Description

I wanted to create a Star Wars quiz for fellow Star Wars fans. This ended up being one of the hardest challenges of the bootcamp. The functionality was very strange in both theory and the way I executed it. I will give myself points for creativty in how I solved it but it did not come out very pretty.

## Credits

I used a lot of google to try and figure out different methods to solve my many issues. W3 schools had a lot of useful documentation.
